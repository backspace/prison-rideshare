<p>Hey, <%= @person.name %>!</p>

<p>This calendar more closely reflects the patterns of times people have traveled to Stony Mountain/Rockwood for since the jailers started allowing visitors again. Hopefully that’ll mean fewer commitments that don’t end up turning into rides. <a href='<%= @link %>'>Here</a> is your unique calendar link for <%= @month %>.</p>

<p>If you don’t know how the calendar works, <a href='https://barnoneblog.wordpress.com/rideshare/driver-calendar/'>here</a> is an explanation.</p>

<p>If you’d like to stop receiving these emails or change your contact information, visit the link and let us know under the “Edit Communication Details” button.</p>

<p>Thanks for volunteering 💞 #FreeThemAll</p>
