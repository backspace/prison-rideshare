<p>Hello <%= @person.name %>,</p>

<p>Visits have resumed for now at Stony Mountain/Rockwood and as you can imagine, riders are eager to see their loved ones on the inside after all this time! <a href='<%= @link %>'>Here</a> is your unique calendar link for <%= @month %>.</p>

<p>If you don’t know how the calendar works, <a href='https://barnoneblog.wordpress.com/rideshare/driver-calendar/'>here</a> is an explanation.</p>

<p>We know everyone is contending with the pandemic in their own ways, so we appreciate if you can still give rides, but we understand if your circumstances prevent that. If you’d like to stop receiving these emails, visit the link and let us know under the “Edit Communication Details” button.</p>

<p>Thanks for volunteering 🤩</p>
